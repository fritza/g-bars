# G Bars

G Bars is an iOS app meant to demonstrate phases of the "Better Step" clinical study application. Separate phases are to appear in separate tabs, varying by what is currently under development and review.

[Daniel Rubin, MD, MS](mailto:DRubin@dacc.uchicago.edu) 

Dan is an anesthesiologist at The University of Chicago Hospitals. He is second-in-charge of quality control, documenting and reviewing surgical accidents.

He holds copyright in the UCAIR industrial safety app.

He is co-author of several studies on using handheld devices to measure cardiac patients’ fitness for surgery. The base application presented a standard survey (DASI), then directed the user to take a 6-minute walk. It collected Core Motion accelerometry to be examined for gait and walking pace. (UChicago ITS was called out on one or two of the journal reports.)

Study-to-study requirements drove “slight” adjustments to the human interface, durations, and sequencing. One constant had been the medium for transferring data: Email. This would be unacceptable but for the  fact that the app was run solely under the supervision of clinical staff, who could correct for interruptions, cancellations, and busted walks. Also, verifying that the report email went only to a certain in-University account, ensuring that the data never passes the firewall.

Replacing this with a secure, hands-off process was always put off for want of a server.

The goal of Better Step (the development of which G Bars supports) is to produce and study a system that collects data and transmits it to the study’s server, hands off. The user will be reminded once a week to take measurements, but so far as the app is concerned, the user is the only driver for navigation, measurement, and reporting.
