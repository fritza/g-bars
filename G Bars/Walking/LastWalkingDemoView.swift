 Further plan for demo walking:

 (deprecated) The min:sec view has to create/hook up with a MotionManager.
 A consumer for AccelerometerItems has to be created, then hook up with a MotionManager.
    The Items are stored as they come in from the manager.

 The consumer can be anything that appends `AcceleratorItem`s. Append to an array, write to file, whatever.

 The MotionManager can be abandoned when the count is done (though in fact it will survive as a global)
 The TimeWatcher, if any can be shared out of the view that already consumes time updates. The Consumet needs only to detect start and finish. I _think_ this is a good idea, rather than have everybody remember to start/stop the consumer.


 Updates in MotionManager start at MotionManager.makeAsyncIterator. So right when you start the async read loop. Is that wise? It may work out that way â€” don't go into the for loop until you're ready to accept the elements.

 Remember to MotionManager.cancelUpdates()

// Remember at the end of each walk to preserve the CSV/data from the observer before resetting it.
// How do we do that? This View consumes it, and the WalkingContainerView has to harvest them at the end of .walk_1 and .walk_2

// `WalkingState` being `AppStages`, it's Hashable, therefore can be keys for `Dictionary`s.

// See WalkingState.csvPrefix for the dataset prefix. WalkingContainerView knows about it.
// Added WalkingState .demoSummary
